            <div className="part-one">Ever since 1897, we have travelled in style, creating defining moments and beautiful<br /> performances for our guests. From the charms of the Belle Epoque to the<br /> extravagances of the opulent 70s, Thee Owens has evolved through the ages, keeping<br /> pace with trends in fashion and design that defined each era. When we expanded<br /> across the globe in the 1990s, widening our constellation of beautiful havens,<br /> we carried the spirit of European luxury with us, embellished with the subtle flavours of<br /> the destinations we now call home.

            
            Through the decades our hotels have been frequented by film <br />stars, world leaders, royalty, nobility, artists, writers and<br /> musicians. And they’ve been the setting for some of life’s greatest <br />moments, from romantic dinners to historic meetings,<br /> breathtaking weddings to family escapes.
